        Iâ€™m Balaji, a web developer instructor with a passion for teaching
        and coding. I specialize in React and front-end development, helping
        students build real-world projects and master modern web technologies. 
        With a background as an English language trainer, I also focus on enhancing communication and career skills.
        Outside of coding, I enjoy continuous learning and
        sharing knowledge to inspire others to achieve their goals.
